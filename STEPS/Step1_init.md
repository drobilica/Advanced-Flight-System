Absolutely, Tailwind CSS has become a popular utility-first CSS framework, and it's completely possible to integrate it with Angular from the get-go. Let's break down how you would typically set up your Angular project with Tailwind CSS:

### Step 1: Project Initialization

1. **Creating a New Angular Project**:
   ```bash
   ng new airplane-ticket-reservation --style=scss
   ```

   We're using SCSS here as it's a powerful CSS preprocessor, but Tailwind doesn't specifically require it. However, having SCSS can be useful if you want to mix Tailwind with SCSS features.

### Step 2: Installing Necessary Libraries

1. **Tailwind CSS**:
   To integrate Tailwind CSS with Angular, you'll need to add the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss postcss-scss postcss-import postcss-loader @angular-builders/custom-webpack -D
   ```

2. **Configuring Tailwind**:
   After installing the necessary packages, generate the `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files:
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

   This will create the two config files in the root of your project.

3. **Angular Build Configuration**:
   Modify `angular.json` to use the custom webpack builder for the builder key of the architect.build and architect.serve sections:
   ```json
   "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser"
   ```

   Then, add a `customWebpackConfig` section pointing to a webpack configuration file:
   ```json
   "customWebpackConfig": {
     "path": "./webpack.config.js"
   }
   ```

   Create a `webpack.config.js` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     module: {
       rules: [
         {
           test: /\.scss$/,
           loader: 'postcss-loader',
           options: {
             postcssOptions: {
               ident: 'postcss',
               syntax: 'postcss-scss',
               plugins: [
                 require('postcss-import'),
                 require('tailwindcss'),
                 require('autoprefixer'),
               ],
             },
           },
         },
       ],
     },
   };
   ```

4. **Integrate Tailwind into Styles**:
   In your `styles.scss` (or the global styling file you chose during Angular project initialization), import Tailwind's styles:
   ```scss
   @import 'tailwindcss/base';
   @import 'tailwindcss/components';
   @import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
   ```

5. **Additional Libraries**:
   - For **Angular Material**, you can run:
     ```bash
     ng add @angular/material
     ```
   - For **ngx-bootstrap**, install via npm:
     ```bash
     npm install ngx-bootstrap bootstrap
     ```
   - If you decide to manage state using the Redux pattern, you can integrate **ngRx**:
     ```bash
     ng add @ngrx/store
     ```

With these steps, you'll have an Angular project set up with Tailwind CSS and other potential libraries. You can then start building out components and utilities using the utility-first classes provided by Tailwind.
