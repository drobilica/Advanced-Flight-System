### Step-by-Step Guide for Your React Project

#### 1. Familiarize with Project Requirements
   - **Objective**: Create a high-fidelity interactive prototype for a virtual assistant application for airline reservations.
   - **Key Features**: Search, create, and view airline reservations. 

#### 2. Define Functional Requirements
   - **Flight Search**: Allow users to search for flights using criteria like airline company, start airport, destination airport, flight duration, distance, class (economy, first class, business), number of available seats, and customer reviews.
   - **Flight Reservations**: Enable users to create and manage reservations.
   - **Conversational Agent**: Integrate a text-based conversational agent for assisting with flight searches and bookings.
   - **User Profile**: Manage user profiles with personal details and reservation history.
   - **Mock Data**: Use static, mocked data for flights and user information as the project does not require a backend.

#### 3. Learn React Basics
   - **Resources**: Utilize online tutorials and official documentation to understand React basics, including JSX, components, props, and state management.

#### 4. Sketch UI Layouts
   - **Draft Sketches**: Draw basic layouts of each screen (e.g., home page, search results, flight details, user profile).
   - **Tool Suggestion**: Use tools like Figma or Adobe XD for refined digital mockups.

#### 5. Set Up React Project
   - **Create App**: Use `create-react-app` for initial setup.
   - **Component Structure**: Plan and create components like Header, SearchForm, FlightList, UserProfile, etc.

#### 6. Develop Static UI
   - **Implement Components**: Build static versions of the components.
   - **Layouts and Styling**: Focus on layout and CSS to match your UI sketches.

#### 7. Add Interactivity
   - **State and Events**: Implement state for dynamic data handling and add event listeners for user interactions.

#### 8. Integrate Conversational Agent
   - **Basic Integration**: Include a text-based agent interface within the app (even if itâ€™s just a mock-up without real AI functionality).

#### 9. Mock Data
   - **Flight Data**: Create a JSON file or a JavaScript object with mock data for flights.
   - **User Data**: Similarly, mock user data for profile management.

#### 10. Implement Navigation and Routing
   - **React Router**: Use React Router for navigating between different screens/pages of your application.

#### 11. Testing and Refinement
   - **Test Interactions**: Ensure all interactive elements like buttons and forms work as expected.
   - **Refine UI**: Make adjustments based on test feedback.

#### 12. Documentation
   - **Document Screens**: Prepare a PDF with screenshots and descriptions of each screen.
   - **Function Descriptions**: Include a brief description of the functionality for each screen.

#### 13. Final Review
   - **Checklist**: Review all functionalities against project requirements.
   - **Final Touches**: Make any last-minute adjustments.

#### 14. Submission
   - **Compile Materials**: Ensure all required materials are ready and in the correct format.
   - **Submit**: Follow the provided guidelines for submission.

#### 15. Optional: Video Demonstration
   - **Record Usage**: Consider creating a short video demonstrating the use of your prototype.
