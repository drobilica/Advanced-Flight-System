To develop your semestral project, an interactive prototype of a virtual assistant for booking flight tickets, it's important to outline a structured approach. Hereâ€™s a plan to guide your project:

### 1. Project Understanding and Requirements Analysis
- **Understand the Scope**: Familiarize yourself with the project requirements, focusing on the need for a high-fidelity interactive prototype without back-end logic implementation.
- **Define the Requirements**: List out features like flight search, booking, user reviews, interactive conversation agent, etc., and what each feature entails.

### 2. Technology Selection
- **Frontend Development**: Choose AngularJS for UI development, as suggested.
- **Chatbot Development**: Use Rasa AI for the conversational interface.
- **Additional Tools**: Decide on any additional tools or technologies required for the prototype.

### 3. Design Phase
- **User Interface Design**: Sketch the UI layout for different screens (e.g., search, booking, flight details, user profile).
- **Chatbot Design**: Outline the conversational flow for the chatbot, including greeting messages, search queries, and booking dialogs.
- **Interactivity Features**: Plan how users will interact with the app (e.g., touch, swipe).

### 4. Prototype Development
- **Build the UI**: Use AngularJS to develop the user interface, keeping in mind usability heuristics.
- **Develop the Chatbot**: Integrate Rasa AI for the conversational aspect, ensuring it aligns with the UI design.
- **Simulate Data**: Since back-end logic is not required, simulate data for display, updates, and deletion.

### 5. Testing and Iteration
- **Initial Testing**: Test the prototype for usability, interface design, and chatbot responsiveness.
- **Feedback Incorporation**: Make necessary adjustments based on testing outcomes.
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Ensure the design aligns with usability heuristics discussed in the course.

### 6. Documentation and Delivery
- **Prepare Documentation**: Create a PDF document with screenshots and descriptions of each prototype screen.
- **Video Demonstration (optional)**: Record a screen capture of the prototype in use, if desired.

### 7. Submission
- **Compile Deliverables**: Ensure you have the prototype (web address or HTML version), the PDF documentation, and the video link (if applicable).
- **Submission to Instructor**: Submit all materials to the subject instructor as per the guidelines.

### Order of Execution:
1. **Project Understanding and Requirements Analysis**
2. **Technology Selection**
3. **Design Phase**
4. **Prototype Development**
5. **Testing and Iteration**
6. **Documentation and Delivery**
7. **Submission**

This plan aligns with your project requirements and ensures a systematic approach to developing your prototype. Remember to continuously refer back to the project brief to ensure all requirements are met.
