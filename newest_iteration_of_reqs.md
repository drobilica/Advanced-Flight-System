### Adjusted Project Plan with React and TailwindCSS

#### 1. Project Understanding and Requirements Analysis
- **Comprehend Project Scope**: Thoroughly understand the project's focus on creating a high-fidelity interactive prototype for a virtual assistant for flight booking.
- **Detail Requirements**: List key features like search, booking, user reviews, and an interactive chat interface.

#### 2. Technology Selection
- **Frontend Development with React**: Choose React for building your user interface, offering a component-based approach that's efficient for UI development.
- **Styling with TailwindCSS**: Utilize TailwindCSS for styling. Its utility-first approach will help in building a clean, responsive design.
- **Chatbot with Rasa AI**: Implement the conversational interface using Rasa AI.

#### 3. Design Phase
- **UI Design with React Components**: Sketch the UI, planning out how React components will be structured for different pages (e.g., flight search, bookings, user profiles).
- **Design System with TailwindCSS**: Define a design system using TailwindCSS to ensure consistency across the application.
- **Conversational Flow for Chatbot**: Plan the dialogues and user interactions for the chatbot.

#### 4. Prototype Development
- **Build UI with React**: Develop the interface using React, creating reusable components.
- **Styling with TailwindCSS**: Apply TailwindCSS for styling components, ensuring responsiveness and adherence to design standards.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Develop the chatbot functionality in alignment with the UI.

#### 5. Testing and Iteration
- **UI and Chatbot Testing**: Test the user interface and chatbot interactions for usability and functionality.
- **Incorporate Feedback**: Revise based on test outcomes and heuristic evaluations.

#### 6. Documentation and Delivery
- **Documenting Screens and Features**: Create a detailed PDF with screen captures and descriptions for each part of the prototype.
- **Video Demonstration (Optional)**: Consider making a video demonstration of the prototype.

#### 7. Submission
- **Finalize Deliverables**: Ensure all components of the project, including the prototype, documentation, and optional video, are ready.
- **Submit to Instructor**: Present your work as per the submission guidelines.
